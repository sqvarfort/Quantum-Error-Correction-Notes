\section{Topological Codes}
In this section, we shall introduce the notion of a topological code. This is the most viable candidate because, as we shall see, it has a pretty good threshold value. 

Previously, we have seen that increasing the robustness is basically equivalent to increasing the distance of the code. Let us look closer at this notion. Start with the $n$-qubit repetition code
\beq
\ket{0}_L = \ket{0}^{\otimes n}
\eeq
\beq
\ket{1}_L = \ket{1}^{\otimes n}
\eeq
For a number $m = n-1$ generators, we have
\beq
Z_1 Z_2, Z_2 Z_3 \ldots Z_{n-1} Z_n
\eeq
The product of all generators gives
\beq
Z_1 \otimes I \ldots \otimes I \otimes Z_n
\eeq
This is no an independent generator. We can work with a graphical representation of a qubit. Let us imagine it as a one-dimensional grid where the qubits are represented by edges. 

\section{Products of Stabiliser Generators}
We say that the three generators $A, B, C$ are not independent if
\beq
AB = C
\eeq
Alternatively, an equivalent definition states that $\{A_1, A_2 \ldots A_n\}$ are independent if and only if there is no product of $A_j$'s that generates the identity.
